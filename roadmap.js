/* ============================================================
   ROADMAP — Spindeck planning board (desktop viewer only)

   Behind the toolbar's "Roadmap" button. Top: a block calendar,
   Aug 2026 → Apr 2027, TWO months on screen at a time but stepping
   by one (August is a two-week stub, see RM_CAL_MONTHS/RM_CAL_SPAN).
   Left: the linear week-by-week timeline (Aug 21 2026 → May 6 2027,
   37 weeks). Right top: short / medium / long term goals.
   Right bottom: meeting notes, one tab per session.

   The RANGE is two constants — RM_START and RM_WEEK_COUNT. The month
   blocks, the year labels and the header line all derive from them,
   so extending the board is one number. See the warning on RM_START
   for the one direction that is NOT safe to change.

   Three levels, deliberately: a WEEK is the workstream ("Design
   pass"), a DAY EVENT is a fixed point inside it ("hand-in, 4pm"),
   a SESSION is the record of one meeting. Clicking a day edits its
   events; clicking a W-number jumps to the week.

   ── Why weeks run Friday → Thursday ──
   Week 1 starts Fri Aug 21. Keeping every week Fri→Thu means one
   calendar ROW is exactly one roadmap WEEK, so the block calendar
   and the linear list line up 1:1 and hovering either lights both.
   That is worth more than a conventional Monday-start grid — the
   day-of-week header reads F S S M T W T for the same reason.

   EVERYTHING IS EDITABLE and autosaves to localStorage under
   RM_KEY, so a reader can rewrite it live and it survives a reload.
   localStorage is per-browser, so notes taken on someone else's
   machine never come back on their own — that is what "Copy Markdown"
   and "Download .md" are for. Say so out loud in the meeting.

   ── Rendering discipline (same rule as PLNEW in app.js) ──
   Editable fields write to state on `input` and DO NOT re-render —
   a re-render mid-keystroke destroys the caret. Only STRUCTURAL
   changes (add/delete a goal, cycle a chip) call rmRender(), and
   those preserve scroll position. Don't add a render call to an
   input handler; typing in a week instead calls rmCalMark(), which
   repaints that week's calendar cells without touching the caret.
   ============================================================ */

   SHORTENING the count past filled weeks) is NOT safe: stored state is keyed by
   index, so week 5's notes would silently re-date, and readers keep their board

/* ── Import: a downloaded .md back into a board ──────────
   The round trip for `rmDownload`. Everything the board holds is already in

   than adding a second one.

   WARNING: it reads the shapes `rmMarkdown` writes, and the two have to move
   together. Section headings (## Goals / ## Timeline / ## Events /
   ## Meeting notes) are the state machine; change a heading there and change it
   here. Labels are mapped back through the same RM_TRACK_LBL / RM_STATUS_LBL /
   RM_TERMS tables the writer used, so a renamed label cannot silently import as
   the wrong track.

   WARNING: anything the document does not mention comes back EMPTY, not
   preserved. This replaces the board; it does not merge into it. That is why
   the caller confirms first and stashes the old board in RM_PREV_KEY.
