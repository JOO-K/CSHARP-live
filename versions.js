   VERSIONS — the "+" above the corner's sessions link (csharpuser,
   2026-09-28). Eric: "a different version but not put it up on the website
   for people to try, just me … above sessions can i get a + and if i press
   that i can go thru versions so 0.1 now 0.11 is next and id like to work
   on the 0.11 while preserving the 0.1".

   The site's own folder is ROOT_VERSION — what GitHub Pages serves and the
   testers use. Every other version is a folder under versions/ (a git
   worktree on its own branch; main ignores versions/, so it is never
   deployed). This file is identical in every version: it reads where it is
   from the URL.

   PRIVATE BY CONSTRUCTION: the "+" is only built on a local address
   (localhost, 127.*, a LAN address, file:), and only lists the versions
   that actually answer. On the public site it does nothing at all.

   ADDING A VERSION: `git worktree add versions/0.14 -b v0.14` from the
   site's folder, then add '0.14' to WIP_VERSIONS and ORDER in every copy of
   this file.

   LANDING ONE: when a version merges into main it becomes the root. Set
   ROOT_VERSION to its name, take it OUT of WIP_VERSIONS (it has no versions/
   folder any more) and leave it in ORDER — then give the version it REPLACES
   a worktree of its own (`git worktree add versions/0.13 v0.13`) and add that
   one to WIP_VERSIONS, or it drops out of the menu with nothing to point at.
   Forgetting the first half is how the root went on calling itself 0.1 for
   three versions; forgetting the second is how '0.13' sat in the menu for a
   day resolving to a 404.

   Desktop viewer only; loads last and touches nothing in app.js.

(function () {
  /* ROOT_VERSION is the NAME OF WHATEVER IS IN THE ROOT FOLDER — i.e. of
     `main` — so it changes every time a version lands there. It read '0.1'
     until 2026-10-08, long after main had gone 0.11 → 0.12 → 0.13: the
     switcher called the root 0.1, and clicking "0.1" opened 0.13's code.
     Nothing named 0.1 is preserved anywhere — the root advanced IN PLACE —
     so '0.1' is gone from the lists rather than pointing at a lie.
     2026-10-09: 0.14 was folded into main, so the ROOT became 0.14 and 0.13
     got a real frozen worktree at versions/0.13 — which is why 0.13 moved
     INTO WIP_VERSIONS and 0.14 moved out of it. Later that day 0.14b took
     the root the same way, and 0.14 went to versions/0.14 and back into the
     list. The two halves always move together. 2026-10-13: 0.14b went live
     as 0.20 the same way — the root is 0.20, 0.14b is versions/0.14b.
     ⚠ Whatever ROOT_VERSION names must NOT be in WIP_VERSIONS: that list
     means "there is a versions/<name>/ folder". '0.13' sat in it for a day
     while 0.13 was still the root and no such folder existed, so `exists`
     HEAD-ed a 404 and silently dropped it from the menu. */
