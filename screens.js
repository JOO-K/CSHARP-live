   template literal evaluated while screens.js parses; app.js hasn't run yet, so

   ⚠️ 5×5, not the 7×7 or 24×24 these replaced. They render at ~15px, so a 7-wide
   grid puts each dot near 2px and the icon reads as grit. Five across is the
   most a glyph this size can carry — the same budget that governs the nav pet.
   ⚠️ Shapes chosen for what SURVIVES the grid, not for fidelity: "Listened" is
   headphones rather than an ear (an ear is a curve with an inner curve, and at
   5×5 that is two grey smudges), and the pencil is a plain 45° stroke because
   the doc's rule is that a dot matrix only does right angles and 45° steps.

/* ══ BENTO SKINS — bought in the shop, worn by the bento ═══════════════════
   `body.sd-skin-<id>` (setBentoSkin in app.js) is what shows one; nothing is
   drawn until then. Two layers, and it takes both:
   · BACK — inside `.v3-bg-fill`, drawn before the silhouette, so the fill's
     one drop-shadow is cast by the UNION of frame + ears + tail. Separate
     layers each cast their own and the frame's landed on the ears and tail.
   · FRONT — flat copies (no shadow) of only what stands OUTSIDE the frame:
     the ears above the top edge and the tail's curl below the bottom one,
     each in an <svg> whose viewBox is cropped to that band so the tucked
     parts clip away. At z-index 4 they sit over the frame's shadow and over
     the feed's sticky "Today" header (z 2), which was painting across the
     tail. Nothing casts a shadow onto them because nothing is above them.
   FURRY (Eric, 2026-09-04, images/skin-furry-source.svg) was drawn in Figma
   over the real bento: the frame is 891 tall with the ears' flat bases at
   y=86.945 — that line is the bento's top edge — and 86.945 + 729.147 =
   816.09 is the bottom edge, which is where the tail's upper arm ends
   (815.66). So the artwork is at (0, -86.945) in bento units; the arm is
   inside the frame and only the curl shows.
   Hand mode mirrors both layers about the bento's centre (see .v3-skin-* in
   app.css) so the ears and tail swap sides with the album.
   Outer ears and tail take the bento's colour; inner ears the same colour a

/* ── The RATE GROUP — the album page's log control (Eric's RateGroup.svg,
   2026-09-18) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   One big circle with two wings hugging its lower half, drawn 1633×1321.
   The circle is RATE — the word until you have rated, your number and discs
   after (syncRevCta paints it). Each wing has two lobes: beside the circle
   and under it. Left wing: Listened (beside) · Listen later (under). Right
   wing: Favorite (beside) · Share (under). The shapes are the SVG; the five
   controls are HTML boxes placed over them in % of the viewBox (see
   .v3-rate-group in app.css), so the taps are real buttons with real labels
   and the artwork never has to know. ⚠️ The wing paths are Eric's, verbatim
   — the offset curve hugging the circle is his, not a computed arc. Edit the
   drawing, not the numbers. Replaces the CTA + quick-log strip. */

/* Inside the circle (Eric, 2026-09-18): "RATE · REVIEW · LOG" set along an
   arc inside the top of the disc (a textPath on a radius-330 arc, centre
   814,486 — the disc's centre, 156 units in from its edge), and in the middle
   "_._" — the shape of the rating that isn't there yet (Eric, same day; it
   was three waving dots for an hour). The arc GLOWS left to right every six
   seconds: its fill is a gradient with a white band, swept across by a SMIL
   animateTransform (~1.8s of sweep, then it rests off to the right) — SMIL
   because a gradient can't be moved from CSS. Rated, the number and discs
   take the middle, the blank goes, and CSS overrides the fill to dark ink
   (a CSS `fill` beats the attribute). ⚠️ The arc path and the gradient need
   ids and the group is rendered once per home variant, so ids are counted.
   ⚠️ The wings are Eric's RateGroupnew2.svg (2026-09-18, rounder again — the
   lower lobes are near-circles now and the drawing grew to 1633×1321; the
   disc is the same 485.6 radius, its centre moved to x 814.345). */

/* csharpuser (2026-09-23): THE FRIENDS DECK — your friends' recent album
   reviews, where the bento used to be. Eric: "focus on reviews and friends'
   reviews … drop-shadow cards that go behind each other like the old-school
   iPod"; then, same day: "get rid of that bento svg … have the album be the
   same size as the bento before … typography pretty similar to before, just
   without the bento … the cards are the same size as the album, offset in z
   so they look smaller, translated horizontally so you can see the next
   albums in the sequence."
   So: NO frame. The FRONT card is the size the bento's album slot was; the
   cards behind it are the same size pushed back in z and stepped out to the
   right, each turned a step further away so the deck curves off in an ARC
   to the screen's edge — the sequence. No CD for now (Eric: "I'll tell you
   when to add it"). The friend's review sits ABOVE the deck (Eric: the
   covers were too high to reach), and under the deck the album page's info
   — the title large with the year beside it, the artist below. No album score line: one rating on screen,
   the friend's. All painted by renderFriendsBento (app.js); this is the
   empty furniture. Hidden with the feed on the album page (--review),
   where `.v3-bento` — still the album page — takes over.
   ⚠ 0.14b (2026-10-09): THIS RENDERS ON THE TRENDING WALL, NOT HOME. Home is
   the hero and then pure reviews; the deck is the first thing on the wall. The
   --review / --rvp hiding above is now moot for it (the wall has no such
   state) but is left alone, in case it comes back to a home shell. */

   was onboarding's chips until step 3 went over to the tree as well
   (2026-09-03). Kept as the editorial order it was — related genres adjacent —
   in case a flat picker ever needs one again. Plain strings — the `&` is a
   real ampersand and gets escaped at render, not stored pre-escaped. */

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   SD_GENRE_TREE — the mix dial's two levels
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Sixteen main genres in the first ring; tapping one takes you into a ring of
   its subgenres, where the picking happens. ⚠ It has TWO readers: Pro's dial in
   the bento, and onboarding's step 3 — the same dial (via the `OB_MIX` context
   in app.js) plus a list view of this same tree (`obRenderGenreList`).

   ⚠ EVERY LABEL HERE EARNS ITS PLACE AGAINST THE REAL ARCHIVE. `shelfPool`
   matches a pick by lowercased CONTAINMENT against an album's primary genre, so
   a label nothing contains is a hole in the dial that silently returns zero —
   which is exactly what the flat dial shipped with (ten of its twenty genres
   matched nothing). Checked before writing this: all 40 subs below match at
   least one album, and the mains land at Pop 69 · Hip-Hop 62 · Electronic 52 ·
   Alternative 40 · Rock 38 · R&B 14 · Indie 6 · Jazz 1.
   ⚠ Re-run that count if you edit this list. A sub that matches nothing looks
   identical to one that does until someone picks it.

   ⚠ Subs may belong to more than one main on purpose — Indie rock is under both
   Rock and Indie, Trip-hop under Electronic and Hip-Hop. Picking is a FILTER,
   not a partition, so overlap costs nothing and matches how people actually
   look for music.
   ⚠ Jazz is thin on its own (1). It works because "All Jazz" expands to the
   main PLUS every sub under it (see `mixShelf`), so it reaches Classical, Folk
   and Soundtrack too. Any main can be thin for the same reason.

   ⚠ A LABEL MUST STAY A SUBSTRING OF THE GENRE IT MEANS. Matching is
   containment, so a name can be shortened to fit the dial only along that rule:
   "Experimental hip-hop" → "Experimental" works, "Psychedelic rock" →
   "Psych rock" matches nothing at all. Three are shortened here because they
   overflowed their slice even fully condensed — and they read fine, because
   inside the Hip-Hop ring "Korean" does not need to say hip-hop again. ⚠ The
   one cost: "Psychedelic" under Rock also catches Psychedelic pop.

   THE PLATE — onboarding's layout is construction geometry, not decoration
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Every number the step-0 screen uses lives here, in a 369×424 viewBox that
   renders 1:1 (369 = the 385px screen less an 8px margin each side). Change a
   vertex and the outline, the construction circles, the bolt holes and the
   ghosts all move together — they are all derived from this one list.

   ⚠ The runs stay orthogonal because consecutive vertices SHARE an x or a y.
   The radii are free to vary; a corner radius cuts the corner, it never tilts
   the run. The single exception is D→E, a deliberate 45° — the diagonal of the
   grid square, so it is still on the grid.                                   */

/* The rig, one level down — drawn in belt-lab.html and saved as
   `Onboarding_Name`, in the PANEL frame, so these already ARE plate
   coordinates. Two equal r26 decks on the x=44 / x=325 rules the top corner
   hubs set (each sits directly under a corner circle — that alignment is the
   whole payoff, so if you move the corner radii move these with them), and a
   big r50 wheel centred on the plate (369/2 ≈ 184) for the belt to hang from.
   Clearance 9 puts the top run at y=213 and the bottom of the loop at y=383.

   ⚠ THE BELT PATH IS SOLVED, NOT PASTED. `belt.js` loads before this file, so
   `obPlateSvg` asks SD_BELT for the shape the same way the lab does — the
   onboarding belt and the lab cannot drift apart, and moving a wheel here is
   one number, not a number and a hand-copied `d`. */

   `${obPlateSvg()}` back inside a `.ob-plate` wrapper in step 0 to bring the

// Profile — "Regular" theme. A short, wide embossed card traced from
// ProfileTheme_Regular.svg (690×401): a left pane holding the profile picture,
// a right pane with location/occupation + bio + the four stat numbers, and a
// rounded Follow pill in the card's bottom-right notch. The 5 favourite-album
// wells sit as a horizontal row of embossed-in circles below the card, and a
// review-history feed follows. Home shell (header · v3-body · nowBar ·
// bottomNav). Funky·Dark / Funky·Light.
// The profile CARD itself (the embossed silhouette + name banner + picture +
// bio + stats + the five favourite-album CDs). Shared, because the Edit Profile
// screen shows the very same card live above its form — building it twice would
// let the preview drift from the real thing.
//   P            the record to draw (PROFILE, or the edit screen's draft)
//   opts.edit    true on the edit screen: no Follow button (it's your own page),
//                the pencil is dropped, and a CD goes straight to the album
//                picker instead of the listen/platforms menu.
/* ══ TAGS — the labels under your name ══════════════════════════════════
   ⚠ These REPLACED "occupation", which was a free-text line saying what you do
   for money. A tag says what you are about, it is CHOSEN from a set rather than
   typed, and — the point — it is a thing you COLLECT. The plain ones are free
   and everyone has them; the specific ones are bought in the shop or handed out
   at something you actually went to. "DaisyChainsFestival2026" is only worth
   wearing because not everyone can.

   ⚠ `tint` is an "R,G,B" TRIPLE, not a hex colour — that is the shop's own
   convention (`.shop-field--tint` does `rgba(var(--tint), .13)`), and a tag has
   to look like the same object on a profile and on a storefront tile.
   ⚠ Anything with a `price` has to be earned; everything else is owned by
   definition. Ownership itself lives in `SD_TAG_OWNED` (app.js) and lasts one
   session, deliberately — see the note there. */
window.SD_TAG_MAX = 3;               // how many you can wear at once

/* ⚠ `tex` names a TEXTURE, one of the `.sd-tex--*` classes in app.css. A tag is
   a thing you collect, and a flat coloured pill does not read as one — a metal
   head's tag should look like brushed steel and a festival's should look like
   the field it was handed out in. That is most of what makes a rare one worth
   wearing at a glance.

   ⚠ The textures are CSS GRADIENTS, not image files, and that is deliberate for
   three reasons: a chip is ~26px tall, where a photographic texture is mush; the
   good free tiling sets (Transparent Textures, Subtle Patterns) are CC-BY and
   carry a real attribution obligation on a shipped app; and gradients cost zero
   requests and re-tint themselves per tag from `--tint`.
   ⚠ They are FILLER by intent. Swapping one for a real image later is a single
   `--tex` value per texture (`url(images/tex-metal.png)` + a `--tex-size`) with
   nothing else in the system to change. */

/* ── Favourite albums — a rail of three, one centred ─────────────────────
   ⚠ This replaces five small wells traced into the bottom of the card. At that

   is not enough to know an album by. Three big ones with the middle one framed
   leaves room under the rail to actually say what you are looking at.

   ⚠ It is CSS scroll-snap, not a custom gesture. This is the one screen element
   that has to feel native under a thumb on a real phone, and the browser's own
   momentum, rubber-band and snap beat anything hand-rolled — the swipe engines
   elsewhere in this app exist because they animate a bento cell, which this
   does not. `padding-inline` on the rail is what lets the FIRST and LAST items
   reach the centre; without it `scroll-snap-align: center` can never centre
   them and the rail looks broken at both ends.
   ⚠ Tapping a disc raises the NAV CONSOLE, not a popup — see `profFavTap`. The
   rail is `overflow-x: auto` and would clip a popup anyway, which is half of why
   the console is the better home for it. */
/* How many times the five discs are repeated to fake an endless rail.
   ⚠ FIVE copies, not three, and the number is set by how far one fling travels.
   The wrap only runs once the scroll SETTLES (writing `scrollLeft` mid-fling
   kills the momentum, see `profFavSettle`), so the buffer either side of the
   middle copy has to outlast the longest gesture a thumb can produce. From the
   middle copy that is ten discs of runway in each direction — about 2500px,
   comfortably past a hard fling. Three copies would leave only five, and a

                   "how dark" are different decisions, and one combined picker
                   throws the depth away every time you move the hue.
                   ⚠ The BACKGROUND you are picking is the page you are standing
                   on: profSkinApply writes --sd-bg onto this very screen, so it

                   already written inline on this very screen, so it follows the

   2.0 is badly reviewed, not divisive. It reads the album's own rating
   distribution, the same `ratingSpreadFor()` bell the histogram on the album
   page draws, so the wall and that chart can't disagree about which records
   split the room.

   ⚠️ **THE MOCK DATA CONTAINS NO ACTUAL DISAGREEMENT**, so this is a stand-in
   and should be replaced the moment real ratings exist. Two measurements, both
   dead ends:
     · `ratingSpreadFor()` — the histogram's bell — floors every bucket at 0.05
       and suppresses low ratings outright, so the bottom tail is pinned at
       exactly 0.20 for all 100 albums. Variance over it ranks the four
       HIGHEST-rated records first (phantom ½★ weight sitting far from a high
       mean), and min-of-tails collapses to `0.4 / total`, which just rewards
       the narrowest bell. Both read as a broken filter.
     · `album.reviews[]` — nearly every album is `[4.5, 4, 4]`; there are two
       distinct spreads across the whole catalogue.
   So it ranks by **proximity to the middle of the scale, weighted by volume**:
   a record parked at 3.4 with 150k reviews is a fair guess at divisive, and a
   4.9 consensus classic is not. `log10` on the count so volume tilts ties
   without letting one blockbuster own the page.
   ⚠️ Real data replaces this with the variance of actual user ratings — at
   which point the wall and the album page's histogram agree by construction,
   which is the whole point of the filter. */

                 ⚠ NO BACKTICKS IN HERE — this comment sits inside a TEMPLATE
                 LITERAL. The first cut quoted class names in backticks the way
                 the rest of the repo's prose does; each one closed the literal
                 and reopened it, so the comment became JavaScript and every
                 screen rendered blank. Same warning as the header handle above.
                 It needs NO new wiring: this screen already carries the
                 s-home-v3 class, so every .s-home-v3 .v3-fb rule applies and
                 closest('.s-home-v3') resolves for the gestures; and
                 populateHomeData runs for every .s-home-v3, so its
                 renderFriendsBento call finds this deck exactly as it found
                 home's. renderFriendsBento skips .v3-fb--dd only — this is the
                 plain .v3-fb, so it is rendered, not skipped.
                 ⚠ Like home's, the deck tints the shell it sits in to the front
                 cover's palette (fbGo ends in setMainAlbum + applyAlbumColorsUrl)

   A playlist is the one thing in the app that is purely YOURS — the archive is
   facts and the reviews are opinions, but a playlist is a made object. So a
   theme changes the card's SHAPE, its type and how it treats the artwork, not
   a tint: five cards in five themes should not look like one card five times.

   ⚠ Every theme is one class on `.pl2-card` and pure CSS from there — no theme
   gets its own markup branch. The card ships the same parts (art, title,
   byline, meta, badges) and each theme decides what to do with them; the moment

   a song::title::album draft with fav set. So the tabs cannot disagree with

   ⚠️ Two thirds of what you swipe past is the runtime rec pool, which is gone
   from ARCHIVE after a reload. The draft therefore carries a snap of the

/* ── Review page (2026-09-11) ────────────────────────────────────────────
   ONE review, in full, with its comments — reached by tapping a review card on
   the album page (`openReviewPage` in app.js, which sets `window.activeReview`
   from the card's registry entry). The card is a summary; this is the review.
   The reviewer leads: their photo (`feedFace` — the same face their comments
   wear), name, handle and when; then the RECORD as a tappable row (→ album
   page); the rating as a sentence; the text at reading size, unclamped; the
   upvote and comment pills; and the thread, always open, under a heading.
   Colour: the shell wears the album's palette like the album page does —
   inline from COLOR_CACHE when the cover has been seen, and openReviewPage
   applies it again once the page exists for the cold case. */
// A heart, not a thumb, on the review page's like (the pill is upvoteHtml's —
// same key, same state — with its glyph swapped).
/* csharpuser (2026-09-23): ERIC'S HEART — the belt-drive one (images/heart-icon.svg
   has the construction). Two belts: each lobe + the tip over outer tangents,
   and the pulley hole concentric in the right lobe. Stroked here like the old
   glyph was (the hole reads as a ring); `.is-on svg { fill: currentColor }`
   fills it and evenodd keeps the hole open. stroke-width 8.5 in a 100 box is
   the 2-in-24 the old heart wore, at the same on-screen size.
   ⚠️ The viewBox is padded 6 units a side: the path runs to the box's very
   edges and half the stroke fell OUTSIDE it, so the lobes and the tip were
   clipped flat ("it's getting cut off"). */
/* (2026-09-23/24 history: the two-path outline/full-with-hole heart and
   its beating hole are in git before this date.) */
/* csharpuser (2026-09-25): BASIC HEART. The belt-and-pulley heart (outline,
   full-with-hole, and the beating hole) is gone — one plain outline path,
   filled by the existing `.is-on svg { fill }` rules when liked. */

/* ── SHOP ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Reached from the SHOP BUTTON IN THE NAV SCOOP (sdShopBtn), which took the
   pet's place. In-app goods only — things that change YOUR Spindeck, not
   physical merch.

   THE SYSTEM — "sheets". A section is one `.shop-sheet`: tiles that butt
   together with a 3px seam of screen bg between them, one outer radius, one
   shadow. Bento density INSIDE a sheet, Apple-Store air BETWEEN sheets. Three
   sheet types and no more:

     --bento   the home bento's own silhouette, rebuilt out of products:
               big square + two stacked + a wide tile under the square, leaving
               the bottom-right as a CORNER GAP with a real fillet at its inner
               corner. The one place the shop admits it is the same object as
               the home screen. Used once, for Pro.
     --shelf   a horizontal rail that bleeds to the frame edge and peeks (the
               `.v3-aa-row` idiom, already the app's convention). Used for
               themes, where the swatch IS the preview and browsing beats
               reading.
     --row     N equal tiles across. Used for frames and badges — small things
               where the product is the glyph.

   ⚠️ Every tile carries its own `--tint`. That is the bento's procedural-colour
   idea moved onto products: the home bento takes its colour from the cover, and
   in here each tile takes its colour from what it sells. It is the only source
   of colour on the screen besides the gold. */
/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   SHOP — the four aisles (SHOP_CATS) and the tickets (SHOP_EVENTS)

   GENERAL is not a category, it is the FRONT of the store — a little of each of
   the other three, in the order you would want to meet them. The other tabs are
   the full shelf. That is why a tile can belong to two aisles at once
   (data-cat="general events"): the storefront shows the same tile the Events tab
   does, rather than a second copy of it that can drift.

   ⚠️ The filter is CSS, not a re-render — see the .s-shop[data-cat=...] block
   in app.css. Switching tabs must not rebuild the screen: the Pro showcase is a
   LIVE bento with a shelf wheel bound to it, and a rebuild would throw that away
   every time you glanced at Themes. */

/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   EVENTS — the one thing in the shop that is not a cosmetic
   ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Everything else in here dresses up your page. A ticket gets you into a room,
   and that difference is why it gets its own sheet type (--list) instead of
   another tray of swatches: a theme is a picture you judge at a glance, an event
   is four facts you read in ORDER — who, what, where-and-when, how much — and a
   square swatch has nowhere to put them.

   ⚠️ `pro: true` is the exclusive half, and it renders BOTH states — the
   locked pill AND the real price button — with body.sd-pro choosing which one
   shows (app.css). No JS, no rebuild: flipping the toolbar's Free/Pro switch
   unlocks the whole list in front of you, which is the entire demo. Gating it in
   JS would have meant a re-render, and a re-render loses the shelf wheel.

   ⚠️ `feat: true` is what General shows, and it is TWO of them, one of each
   kind. The storefront gets two rows to say both "there are tickets here" and
   "some of these are Pro's", so it cannot spend them on two of the same thing.

   The art is album art already in images/ — these are artists whose records are
   in the archive, so the storefront never bills a record the app has never
   heard of. */

  /* csharpuser (2026-09-22): THREE buttons — Home · Trending · Profile. The
     Shop and Playlists items and the "friends listening now" panel are gone
     with their screens. (2026-09-23): FOUR — Search is the second button
     (Eric), the same openSearch the header's bubble calls; it mounts the
     overlay into whichever .app-screen the nav is on.
     csharpuser (2026-09-23): THE HUMP IS GONE TOO. Eric: "just turn it into
     an oval bar without that bump". The bar is a plain pill now — no inline
     contour <svg>s, no data-URI masks: `.v3-nav-glass` is a border-radius
     and a 1px border (app.css, THE NAV CONSOLE). The CD console still opens
     upward out of it: the pill grows into a rounded rect (`--nav-ar` /
     `--nav-r` swap on `.s-home-v3--console`) and the panel sits in the room
     that opens above the icons. Same principle, no plateau.
     Floats centred, 14px off the bottom, over the content. The ORIGINAL's
     history (docked bar 08-20 → 09-03, the scoop, the pet, the shop bag) is
     in c-sharp/screens.js. */

                 It was a sibling positioned in px from the screen bottom, and the
                 nav is aspect-ratio driven — its height follows the frame width —
                 so the two drifted apart the moment the viewer scaled the phone
                 and the panel floated out of the plateau it is meant to sit in.
                 As a child it can be placed as a % of the nav's own box, which is
                 the only thing that tracks the plateau at every size. -->
