For every taste row we ask the Deezer public API (no key, no scraping) for the
artist and the album, and keep the **CDN image URL** rather than downloading the
file — see ARTWORK_AT_SCALE.md. Four personas' worth of covers would otherwise
add hundreds of images to the repo, and the whole point of the coming Dropbox
move is to keep them out of it.

Writes personas.js at the repo root. Responses are cached in
