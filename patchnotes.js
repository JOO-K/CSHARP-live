/* ============================================================
   FEEDBACK — the user-testing chrome (csharpuser, 2026-09-25; cut down
   2026-09-26: the Patch notes panel and the tester's page rail are gone —
   "lets just make it so the feedback box that pops up has no text, just a
   textbox and post"). PATCH_NOTES stays as data: its top date is the build
   tag on every recording and every note.
   Eric: "we are reappropriating this website to be more about user testing
   … replace [the dev stuff] with patchnotes in the upper left with a
   feedback button next to it". Two buttons in the toolbar's left section
   (index.html) open two popovers built here. Desktop viewer only; loads
   last and touches nothing in app.js.

   The dev toolbar, the left page rail and the recs bar are still in the
   page — `?tools` on the URL brings them back (body.sd-tools, app.js), the
   same switch the mobile side already had.

   ADDING A NOTE: put a new entry at the TOP of PATCH_NOTES. `date` is shown
   as written; `items` are one line each, in tester language (what changed
   for the person holding the phone, not how). The newest entry is marked.
